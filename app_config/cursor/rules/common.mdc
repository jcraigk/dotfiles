# Git

NEVER use git or any other version control system to commit or push code without explicit instructions.

When running a local git diff, use "git --no-pager -c pager.diff=false -c color.ui=never diff --no-ext-diff" 

A commit message must be a single line less than 100 characters.

When updating a PR description on GitHub:
- First fetch the current PR content
- Preserve any existing elements like images, links, or formatting that the user might have added beyond what may be in context history
- Only modify the specific sections that need updating


# Terminal

Do not "cd" into the current project directory - you're already there!

When using CLI tools that may use a pager, prefix with PAGER=cat to disable paging.

When running a Rails command use "rails runner" and pass it the code instead of "rails console" which requires an interactive session.


# Coding style

Use comments very infrequently when generating or updating source code. Well written software speaks for itself.
