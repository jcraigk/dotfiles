# Git

NEVER use git or any other version control system to commit or push code without explicit instructions.

A commit message MUST be a single line between 20 and 100 characters. Be as concise as possible. Use imperative mood.

When updating a PR description on GitHub:
- First fetch the current PR content
- Preserve any existing elements like images, links, or formatting that the user might have added directly via the GitHub website
- Only modify the specific sections that need updating


# Terminal

Do not "cd" into the current project directory - you're already there!


# Coding style

Use comments very infrequently when generating or updating source code. Well written software speaks for itself.
