# Git

NEVER use git or any other version control system to commit or push code without explicit instructions.

When running a local git diff, use "git --no-pager -c pager.diff=false -c color.ui=never diff --no-ext-diff" 


# Terminal

Do not "cd" into the current project directory - you're already there!

When using CLI tools that may use a pager, prefix with PAGER=cat to disable paging.

When running a Rails command use "rails runner" and pass it the code instead of "rails console" which does not allow input from Cursor.


# Coding style

Use comments sparingly when writing code. Well written code speaks for itself.
