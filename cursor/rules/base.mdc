# Git

CRITICAL: Never git commit without explicit instructions from me.

Examples of what NOT to do:
- ❌ "I'll commit these changes" (without being asked)
- ❌ "Let me commit to save our progress"
- ❌ "Committing the fixes now"

Examples of CORRECT behavior:
- ✅ "The changes are ready. Would you like me to commit?"
- ✅ "All issues are fixed. Let me know if you want me to commit."

CRITICAL: Comments in generated code and specs should be kept to bare minimum.
DEFAULT TO NO COMMENTS. When in doubt, omit the comment.
Each comment added should be justified as absolutely essential.

Commit messages must be a single line, 20–80 characters, in imperative mood.

Branch names must be 5–25 characters, using only lowercase letters and dashes.

When creating pull requests, ALWAYS follow the pull request template for the project if it exists. Otherwise simply be concise and direct in pull request descriptions.


# Terminal

NEVER `cd` into the current project directory to run a command - you're already there!

NEVER run `rails console`. Use `rails runner` instead.

Using rails runner:
- When inserting Ruby code into `bin/rails runner`, wrap the whole snippet in single quotes unless you need shell interpolation.
- If you must use double quotes, escape all Ruby globals like `$stdout` and `$stderr` as `\\$stdout` / `\\$stderr`.
- Do not pipe `| cat` after runner commands.
- For multi-line snippets, use a heredoc (`<<'RUBY'`) or a .rb file instead of inline double quotes.

If you're having trouble with ruby versions when running ruby commands in a terminal, run "$(mise activate zsh)" first.
