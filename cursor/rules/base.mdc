# Git

CRITICAL: Never git commit without explicit instructions from me.

CRITICAL: Comments in generated code and specs should be kept to bare minimum.

Commit messages must be a single line, 20–80 characters, in imperative mood.

Branch names must be 5–25 characters, using only lowercase letters and dashes.

Pull request (PR) titles and descriptions must be concise and imperative. PR descriptions must not exceed 300 words.

If working on a Jira ticket, pull request titles must be prefixed with the ticket ID in brackets. Example: "[ABC-123] My title..."

When updating a PR, preserve any attachments or images the user may have added outside of chat.


# Terminal

NEVER `cd` into the current project directory to run a command - you're already there!

NEVER run `rails console`. Use `rails runner` instead.
