## Google Workspace

My email address is justin.craigkuhn@gusto.com


## Datadog MCP

If no results are being returned or the server is not available, run the following command and then try again: ~/workspace/gusto-cli/dist/gdev-mcp

## Atlassian MCP

Our Atlassian Cloud ID is "3fd33630-4e39-4689-ad04-db32e3843117".

Our BuildKite org slug is 1355395. Our pipeline slug is zenpayroll.

Jira tickets look like "PREFIX-x" Where x is an integer.

I will sometime use shorthand like "jira x" where x is an integer. This means "EMBC-x" since EMBC is the default prefix.

# Pre-commit Hooks

Whenever a change is made to any file, you must run the precommit hooks and iteratively fix the issues before ending the session. If no changes were made to project files, skip this step altogether.

When you are about to end a session after changing a file, do this:

- Open a terminal and run: `lefthook run pre-commit`
- If any hook fails (Rubocop, ESLint, etc.), carefully read the output.
- Fix the code accordingly, then rerun `lefthook run pre-commit` until it exits successfully.
- If the hook has a `stage_fixed: true` or `--fix` option (Rubocop autocorrect, ESLint --fix), apply those edits directly to the files instead of staging/committing.
- Do NOT run `git commit`, `git push`, or stage files. Your role is only to edit files so that `lefthook run pre-commit` passes cleanly.
- When all hooks pass, summarize what was fixed and only then finish.

# Git

Commit messages and pull request titles must be a single line, 20–80 characters, in imperative mood and should be prefixed with the ticket ID in brackets. Example: "[ABC-123] Enforce permissions in UsersController"

# Data

Use Redash for querying production data. Use "ZP Demo Read Replica (MySQL)" for the demo environment and "_EDW PII Safe" for production. Zenpayroll tables are prefixed with "zenpayroll_production_no_pii."
