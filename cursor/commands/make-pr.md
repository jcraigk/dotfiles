This command may be followed by an optional argument, which is the pull request  (PR) number or branch.

1. Run the "/git-push" command
2. Create a PR if one doesn't already exist.
3. If one does exist, update the description and title to reflect the latest changes, if necessary. Do not reveal the content was edited (avoid "NEW" and "UPDATE" language).
